As coding bootcamps such as [Coder Academy](https://coderacademy.edu.au/) and [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) churn out more and more software developers, and as more and more people start to realise the importance of software, companies these days are facing an increased amount of candidates applying for junior dev roles.

I'll break the tips into three sections: before an interview, during an interview and after an interview.

## Before an Interview

This is arguably the most important stage of your interview - before it happens! Prepare yourself with enough knowledge and confidence in both software development and conversational skills in order to ace the interview and stand out amongst a sea of candidates.

### Get More Project Experience

Build your own side projects, participate in open source projects, pick up some freelancing work - the choice is yours. These won't be your most technically accomplished work, but they will help you accumulate experience, and more importantly to demonstrate your capability to your interviewers with real world experience.
