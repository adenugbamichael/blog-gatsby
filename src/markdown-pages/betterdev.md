Now, let's break down the tips into three main areas: **mindset**, **technical** and **people**. The goal of this article is to raise awareness of the topics mentioned, if you want to understand more on a particular topic I encourage you to do your own research.

### Have a StarCraft Mindset

In essence, it's a mindset that requires you to always consider things around you, and forces you to think beyond your narrowly focused task at hand.

### Micro-Services is Neither New nor the Holy Grail

There's the age-long debate of monolith vs micro-services architecture, and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) has been around for decades. Each has its own pros and cons, don't get bought into the hype because a blog post says so, or a particular product and company found it successful. Use the right tool for the right job.

## Final Thoughts

Software development is evolving rapidly, some fundamentals however are always useful and relevant. I hope you find this article useful.
